# Server Side jQuery Calculator

## Description 

Duration: 3 days

Building upon what I have learned from the previous week, I will now be incorporating server side functionality to divide up my JavaScript files between client and server. I will be creating a user interface that will accept two values, a mathematical operator, and an equal button giving you the result. After that button has been clicked, I want to put that information into an object and send it to my server with POST. I will also add a 'C' button for the user to clear their input and run it again. My server will handle all the calculator logic, and the data can be sent back to the client side in an object that can be displayed on the DOM.


## Setup

1. npm install
2. npm run server
3. npm run client

## Usage 

1. Enter numbers in the input field and select you mathematical operator in the middle. 
2. the "=" button will fire off a post ajax call to the server and run the logic
3. Use the "c" button the clear the answer on the DOM.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Node modules
