# Server Side jQuery Calculator

Building upon what I have learned from the previous week, I will now be incorporating server side functionality to divide up my JavaScript files between client and server. I will be creating a user interface that will accept two values, a mathematical operator, and an equal button giving you the result. After that button has been clicked, I want to put that information into an object and send it to my server with POST. I will also add a 'C' button for the user to clear their input and run it again. 

## Description

The reason this is important is that the server side can handle all the important calculations, while the client side can just worry about receiving the inputs from the user. Ideally, the server will always remain on, and keep a record of every calculation.
