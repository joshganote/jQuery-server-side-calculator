# Server Side jQuery Calculator

Building upon what I have learned from the previous week, I will now be incorporating server side functionality to divide up my JavaScript files between client and server. I will be creating a user interface that will accept two values, one initial value, a mathematical operator, by another number, with an equal button giving you the result. After that button has been clicked, I want to put that information into an object and send it to my server with POST. I will also add a 'C' button for the user to clear their input and run it again.
